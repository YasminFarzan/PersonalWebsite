                About Me:
                My name is Yasmin Farzan, a rising senior at Virginia Tech. I am majoring in Chemical Engineering, with minors in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Chemistry. I love exploring new topics, and have many various hobbies. I occasionally post YouTube videos about my Persian culture, have taken a social media internship, and am the founder of two clubs on campus: Model United Nations at Virginia Tech and the Cringe Crocs Club. This summer, I decided to CS 3744: Introduction to GUI and Computer Graphics. In this course, I learned so much about safety, interfaces object-oriented graphical user interfaces (GUI), and worked with different languages and libraries. You may view the projects I worked on in the Projects tab.
